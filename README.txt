This Progam makes use of the color picker program (check repo: ) , to create an interactive Virtual paint video camera capture
that can automatically recognize a certain color on any physical object gitcaptured on the webcam , and follow its motion in real-time
by drawing a similar hue on the screen . Hence the name : Virtual Paint.
